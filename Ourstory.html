And the competition isn’t even close.Novelty mugs will never be boring. They go beyond a tasteful earth tone glaze to a look that actually says something. (Most of the time quite literally.) Think of the designs, think of the memories! I hear the groovy guitar and strings from Lost in Music every time I drink from my LISTEN TO SISTER SLEDGE mug.The minute you start sipping your morning coffee from something a little less tasteful and a little more playful, we know you’ll feel more joyful, more snug, more at ease even. That’s because novelty mugs are made to pull on your heartstrings and remind you of happier times. That and, well, the really comfortable handle.</p>
